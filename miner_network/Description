Integrated data was obtained with seurat analysis and scaled counts data was utilized for miner network modeling.

Steps for MINER analysis from single cell data can be obtained from https://github.com/baliga-lab/miner3

MINER network model files can then be processed downstream using the R notebook https://github.com/ishita-ISB/UW_duke_analysis/blob/main/miner_network/MINER_overview_netresults_1.Rmd
